## intro
Small businesses (restaurants, bars, cleaners, etc.) are suffering. Many will go broke during quarantines and all will struggle to get business back afterwards. This not only affects the owners, but the employees of those businesses and ultimately the patrons. Our over-arching goal is to help small businesses weather the storm in the short term and be positioned to recover and thrive in the long term by (a) helping the businesses know who their most supportive patrons are, and (b) providing a method for consumers to see their local businesses in need and link out to funding/support mechanisms (e.g. TipJar, GoFundMe, etc.)
